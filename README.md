# Sentiment-Analysis-and-Brand-Perception-in-Python-using-NLP
This sentiment analysis project focuses on analyzing and understanding the sentiments expressed by customers towards a brand. By leveraging the power of data and NLP techniques using python, this project aims to provide insights about the sentiments shared by customers and the factors that contribute to positive or negative sentiment. It utilizes matplotlib and seaborn libraries to create charts, graphs, and word clouds that highlight key insights and sentiments.
In addition to sentiment analysis, this project goes a step further by extracting the underlying reasons behind the sentiments expressed. By analyzing the textual content of customer feedback, it identifies the factors that contribute to positive or negative sentiment.
